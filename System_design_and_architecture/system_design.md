### System Design Description 

1. **IoT Devices**:
   - These devices collect data from various sensors and send it to the backend system.

2. **Message Broker (Kafka)**:
   - Kafka acts as the message broker for real-time data ingestion from IoT devices. It ensures the data is efficiently collected and queued for processing.

3. **Processing (Flink)**:
   - Apache Flink is used for real-time data processing and transformation. It processes the incoming data streams from Kafka and applies necessary transformations and computations.

4. **Storage (SQL/NoSQL)**:
   - The processed data is stored in both SQL and NoSQL databases. SQL databases (such as PostgreSQL) are used for structured data, while NoSQL databases (such as MongoDB) are used for unstructured or semi-structured data.

5. **API Layer (Flask/Spring)**:
   - The API layer is implemented using Flask (for Python) or Spring Boot (for Java). It exposes RESTful APIs to allow external systems to interact with the processed and stored data.

6. **Analytics (Redshift)**:
   - Amazon Redshift, a data warehousing solution, is used for storing aggregated data. It facilitates complex queries and analytics on large datasets.

7. **Data Warehouse**:
   - The data warehouse stores processed and aggregated data for long-term storage and advanced analytics.

### Data Flow

1. **IoT Devices** send data to the **Message Broker (Kafka)**.
2. **Kafka** queues the data for real-time processing.
3. The data is processed by **Flink**, where it is transformed and analyzed.
4. Processed data is stored in **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases.
5. The **API Layer (Flask/Spring)** provides endpoints for accessing the data.
6. **Analytics (Redshift)** processes and stores aggregated data.
7. The **Data Warehouse** stores processed and aggregated data for further analysis and reporting.
